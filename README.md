**Registration Form**

Collects user details: Name, Email, Phone Number, and Password.

Validates inputs using JavaScript (e.g., no numbers in names, valid email format, strong password with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character).

On successful submission, shows a success alert and navigates to the To-Do list page.

**To-Do List Page**

Allows users to add tasks using an input field.

Tasks are displayed in a list.

Clicking on a task immediately removes it, indicating itâ€™s completed.
