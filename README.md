**Registration Form**

**2.** Validates inputs using JavaScript (e.g., no numbers in names, valid email format, strong password with uppercase, lowercase, number, and special character).

**3.** On successful submission, shows a success alert and navigates to the To-Do list page.

**To-Do List Page**

**1.** Allows users to add tasks using an input field.

**2.** Tasks are displayed in a list.
